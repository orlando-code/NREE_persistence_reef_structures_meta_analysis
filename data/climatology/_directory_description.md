Past and future pH and sea surface temperature conditions from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Version 6 (CMIP6) are provided for the sites of interest as `.csv` files in the `data/climatology/` directory in the repository. The conditions relate to the sites for which coral cover was measured and for which which benthic samples were extracted to subject to experimental treatments.
