This data was manually extracted from 137 papers following a systematic review. The dataset generated, detailing measured calcification and bioerosion rates alongside the experimental carbonate conditions, is available at xxx<sup>1</sup>.

The highlighted cells in the `.xlsx` file indicate parameters which were measured in experiment. These highlighted cells are then used to compute the carbonate chemistry parameters used throughout the analysis.
