`extracted_bioerosion_data.xlsx` and `extracted_calcification_data.xlsx`

This data was manually extracted from published papers following a systematic review. The dataset generated, detailing measured calcification and bioerosion rates alongside the experimental carbonate conditions, is available at xxx<sup>1</sup>.

The highlighted cells in the `.xlsx` files indicate parameters which were measured in experiment. These highlighted cells are then used to compute the carbonate chemistry parameters used throughout the analysis.
